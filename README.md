# Face-Emotion-Recognition
Leveraged the Deepface package, a popular open-source Python library for facial recognition and facial attribute analysis.
Used a scripting language (likely Python) to design and implement facial recognition and analysis tasks.
Developed a solution that takes an image as input and uses Deepface to detect and output the emotion of the face in the image.
Successfully designed and implemented solutions that could analyze and interpret facial attributes, specifically focusing on emotion detection, showcasing advanced skills in machine learning and computer vision.
